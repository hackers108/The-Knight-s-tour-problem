# The-Knight-s-tour-problem
This project focuses on solving the Knight’s Tour problem, a classic chess puzzle where a knight must traverse an N × N chessboard, visiting each square exactly once while following the knight's movement rules. The knight starts at the top-left corner of the board and explores all possible paths to complete the tour.

The project employs an efficient backtracking approach to systematically find a valid sequence of moves.
