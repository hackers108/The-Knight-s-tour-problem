# The-Knight-s-tour-problem
This project focuses on solving the Knight’s Tour problem, a classic chess puzzle where a knight must traverse an N × N chessboard, visiting each square exactly once while following the knight's movement rules. The knight starts from any custom input on the board and explores all possible paths to complete the tour.

The project employs an efficient backtracking approach to systematically find a valid sequence of moves.
